
Thank you for downloading Autumn Parallax Forest.

The assets in this package can be used to create your own static or parallax backgrounds.

Here is an overview of the contents of this package:

------------------------------------------------------

------------

------------
Materials:
------------

Contains 4 leaf materials for the falling leaves particle systems.

- leaf_1
- leaf_2
- leaf_3
- leaf_4

And 2 particles which are used by the 'rays' particle system.

- ray_particle
- sparkle_particle

------------
Prefabs:
------------

Contains 4 falling leaves particle systems:

- falling_leaves_1
- falling_leaves_2
- falling_leaves_3
- falling_leaves_4

And a sparkle rays particle system for the gold coins:

- rays


------------
Scripts:
------------

Contains the BGScroller script which is used in the 'parallax demo' scene. The script can be added to any Game Object and a Scroll Speed value can be assigned to make the Game Object scroll endlessly. 


------------
Sprites:
------------

For optimization purposes, all asset dimensions are divisible by 4. All assets are at 4k resolution with normal compression applied in the editor.

Src PSD's:
------------

I've provided 2 PSD source files.

- "parallax_autumn_forest_src": this is the main source file, containing all assets, layed out as to provide an example for a possible end result.
- "parallax_autumn_forest_assets": contains all final assets at 4k resolution, layed out in a grid.


------------
Textures:
------------

Contains 2 textures that are used by the 'rays' particle system.


------------------------------------------------------
DEMO:
------------

I've included two demo scenes. 'assets overview demo' contains all assets layed out in a grid per parallax layer. 'parallax demo' shows an example of an endlessly scrolling background.
The parallax demo scene is only there to show a possible implementation for the background and to provide an example of the layer order.
To view the examples, simply open each scene and run it.
